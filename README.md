Hey there! I just created an awesome music app that allows you to explore different genres of music.MyMusicWiki is an unofficial Last.fm application that provides users with a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of various music genres. The app offers detailed information about albums, artists, and tracks associated with each genre, making it a valuable resource for music enthusiasts.
